# Introduction to the Design System for TARS

We are TARS love Trello's Nacho Design System and, Trello got acquired by Atlassian. We kind of missed the Design System, so we thought of building our own with the same design. The open-source community can use the same if they love Trello's kind of Design.

Our product is hugely inspired by Trello!
